# Logarithmic_Barrel_Shifter
Designed a 32-bit logarithmic barrel shifter in structural Verilog supporting logical/arithmetic shifts and rotate operations (0â€“31 bits) using an 8-bit command word defining shift amount, direction, operation type, and mode. Verified in Vivado with Python-assisted automated testing for accuracy and efficiency.
